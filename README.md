# CitiBike Trip Duration Predictor 

Jasmine Ng, Callie Busch & Allison Grimsted

This repository contains an analysis on CitiBike trip data. Our goal is to predict trip duration based on user and 
situational covariates in order to generate insight on bike availability at a rider's vicinity. By predicting bike 
trip duration and given the location of the a rider's starting doc, we can create a radius of the rider's ending 
location, thereby predicting when a bike will be arrive at a specific citibike doc.
