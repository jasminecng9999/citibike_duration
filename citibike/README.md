# CitiBike Trip Duration Predictor 

Jasmine Ng, Callie Busch & Allison Grimsted

This repository contains an analysis on CitiBike trip data. Our goal is to predict trip duration based on user and situational covariates in order to generate insight on availability of bikes at a rider's vicinity. By predicting the duration of a bike and receiving information on the starting doc, we are able to get a radius of the ending location's proximity, thereby finding the ending doc.
